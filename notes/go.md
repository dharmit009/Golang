# Go:

**GO is Objected Oriented Language** but it is a weak object oriented
language. GO is compiled language though it has some features of
interpreted language for e.g: *Garbage Collection*.

## OOP's

**GO** does not uses the term class instead we use *structs*.

* No Inheritance.
* No Constructor.
* No Generics. [ Now, it does offer generics (from: Go v1.18)]
