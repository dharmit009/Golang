# Runes:

**What are Runes?**

Runes are characters which can be defined using code points. Runes can
store the following: 

    - Letters.
    - Numbers.
    - Emoji's. 
    - Symbols.

You can use single quotes and backticks while declaring the runes.
**⚠️  Note:** Always use `single quotes` (') for declaring rune which is
on your keyboard. If you are declaring a character which is not on your
keyboard use `backticks` (`).

## Raw Literals:

You can use raw literals when your strings include single quotes and
double quotes. In raw literal we use backticks (`).
