# Operators:

**Types of Operators:**
    
1. Arithmetic Operators.
1. Logical Operators and Relational Operators.

## Arithmetic Operators:

Arithmetic Operators always return a number.

| Arithmetic Operators | Operator Symbols |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Addition             | +, +=            |
| Substraction         | -, -=            |
| Multiplication       | *, *=            |
| Division             | /, /=            |
| Remainder            | %, %=            |
| Increment            | ++               |
| Decrement            | --               |

## Relational Operators:

Relational Operators always return a boolean value.

| Relational Operators | Operator Symbols |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Less Than            | <                |
| Less Than Equal      | <=               |
| Greater Than         | >                |
| Greater Than Equal   | >=               |
| Equal To             | ==               |
| Not Equal            | !=               |

## Logical Operators:

| Logical Operators | Operators Symbol |
|-------------------|------------------|
| AND               | &&               |
| OR                | \|\|             |
| NOT               | !                |
