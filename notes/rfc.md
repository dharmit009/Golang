Golang provides packages for important RFC's. This packages provides
functions such as `encode` & `decode`.

**Example:**

net/http package:

* Web communication protocol.
* http.Get(www.uci.edu)

net package:

* TCP / IP & Socket Programming.
* net.Dial("tcp", "uci.edu:80")

Whenever you don't have the RFC's you will need to create one.
