# Basic Data Types: 

Go has one of the most comprehensive list of data types and they are as follows: 

* bool 

* string

* int (Integers: Both positive and negative Integers)
	* int8
	* int16
	* int32
	* int64

* uint (Unsigned Integer: Only positive Integers)
	* uint8
	* uint16
	* uint32
	* uint64
	* uintprt: Looks like this is unsigned integer pointer. 

* byte (alias for uint8)

* rune (alias for int32): represents Unicode code point.

* float (Defaults to float32)
	* float32
	* float64

* Complex Numbers 
	* complex64
	* complex128

Yeah Golang even supports complex numbers (2 + 4i).

**DOUBT:** What's a Unicode Code point?
